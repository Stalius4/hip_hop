      <p class="text-pos">Breaking, also called B-boying/B-girling or breakdancing,  rhythmic style of dance which developed as one of the major elements of hip hop culture. Like many aspects of hip hop culture, breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures, including 1930s-era street dancing, Brazilian and Asian Martial arts, Russian folk dance and the dance moves of James Brown, Michael Jackson and California funk.<br>

      <p class="text-pos">Rapping (also known as emceeing, MCing, spitting (bars), or just rhyming) refers to "spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics with a strong rhythmic accompaniment". Rapping typically features complex wordplay, rapid delivery, and a range of "street slang", some of which is unique to the hip hop subculture.<br><br><br>

    <p class="text-pos">Beatboxing is the technique of vocal percussion, in which a singer imitates drums and other percussion instruments with her or his voice. It is primarily concerned with the art of creating beats or rhythms using the human mouth. The term beatboxing is derived from the mimicry of the first generation of drum machines, then known as beatboxes.<br><br>

    <p class="text-pos">DJing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and beats using two or more phonograph turntables, tapes, CDs or digital audio files and a DJ mixer. One of the first few hip hop DJs was Kool DJ Herc, who created hip hop in the 1970s through the isolation and extending of "breaks" - the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat.<br>
